### Overview

**itsAlive** is an attempt to add tangibility to functional reactive programming (FRP) for the purpose of making FRP easier and more accesible to programmers who are new to it.

It does this by introducing the concept of **living values** - variables that are allowed to mutate but only do so in a controlled fashion. See [documentation](#documentation)
